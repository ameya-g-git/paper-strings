            - music bars in background
            - gradients (some blurry, some not) in the background, makes things more Lush
            - obviously tons of music iconography, use glassy shapes + gradients just because those look clean
            - thinking to just throw the logo on the hero page as well to take up space
            - scroll down arrow animation teehee
